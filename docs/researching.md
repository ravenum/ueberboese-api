## Researching the API

When running and using this Docker image, the log file folder will collect all requests that are made.
To get a simple statistic, run:
```bash
grep -r -h -o -P "Target URL: \K\S+" /path/to/your/log_folder | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

This will return something like
```
    753 https://streaming.bose.com/streaming/account/6921042/full
     74 https://streamingoauth.bose.com/oauth/device/587A628A4042/music/musicprovider/15/token/cs3
     28 https://streaming.bose.com/streaming/account/6921042/device/587A628A4042/recent
      9 https://streaming.bose.com/streaming/account/6921042/device/587A628A4042/recents
      5 https://streaming.bose.com/streaming/support/power_on
      2 https://streaming.bose.com/?serialnumber=123123AW
```

If you did the advanced set-up, also the reported events are logged to a dedicated file.
To look which event types got reported run
```bash
grep -h "event: " event-requests*.log 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*event[^:]*: //' | jq -r '.payload.events[]?.type' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```
This shows something like
```

   1396 item-started
   1168 art-changed
    296 system-state-changed
    201 source-state-changed
