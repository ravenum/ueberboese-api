# Überböse Api 🔈🎶

**Überböse:** /ˈyːbɐˌbøːzə/ *(german) adjective - extremely or supremely evil; beyond ordinary wickedness.*

Bose has stopped supporting its consumer streaming boxes called SoundTouch on May 6, 2026 ☹️
This renders millions of completely working streaming boxes useless.

From their last [announcement](https://www.bose.com/soundtouch-end-of-life):
> What no longer works:
>
>- Presets (preset buttons on the product and in the app)
>- Browsing or playing music services directly from the SoundTouch app
>- Stereo pairing for SoundTouch 10

This projects helps you overcome these limitations with a self-hosted server that replaces the Bose streaming HTTP API.

## Documentation

**Full documentation is available at: https://julius-d.github.io/ueberboese-api/**

- [Quick Start Guide](https://julius-d.github.io/ueberboese-api/quick-start) - Step-by-step installation and configuration
- [Überböse Api Spec](https://julius-d.github.io/ueberboese-api/ueberboese-api-specification) - The missing api-specification. These are the endpoints your speaker calls.

## Features

- Easy installation with Docker Compose
- Spotify OAuth integration support
- Self-hosted and open source
- Comprehensive logging for API research

With the Überböse Api and the
[Überböse App](https://github.com/julius-d/ueberboese-app) you can
- boot up your speakers without any problems
- play presets from Spotify, TuneIn, and internet radio
- change presets to other Spotify, TuneIn, and internet radio stations
- create multi room zones
- create and change stereo pairs

This has been tested on:
- SoundTouch 10
- SoundTouch 20
- SoundTouch 30
- SoundTouch 300

## Installation

See the [Quick Start Guide](https://julius-d.github.io/ueberboese-api/quick-start).

## Researching the API

When running and using this Docker image, the log file folder will collect all requests that are made.
To get a simple statistic, run:
```bash
grep -r -h -o -P "Target URL: \K\S+" /path/to/your/log_folder | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

This will return something like
```
    753 https://streaming.bose.com/streaming/account/6921042/full
     74 https://streamingoauth.bose.com/oauth/device/587A628A4042/music/musicprovider/15/token/cs3
     28 https://streaming.bose.com/streaming/account/6921042/device/587A628A4042/recent
      9 https://streaming.bose.com/streaming/account/6921042/device/587A628A4042/recents
      5 https://streaming.bose.com/streaming/support/power_on
      2 https://streaming.bose.com/?serialnumber=123123AW
```

If you did the advanced set-up, also the reported events are logged to a dedicated file.
To look which event types got reported run
```bash
grep -h "event: " event-requests*.log 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*event[^:]*: //' | jq -r '.payload.events[]?.type' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```
This shows something like
```
   4479 play-state-changed
   1396 item-started
   1168 art-changed
    296 system-state-changed
    201 source-state-changed
